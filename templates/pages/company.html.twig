                <p>
                    <b>Our success stems from a focused commitment to every aspect of vehicle dismantling, whilst continually improving the standard of service given to it's customers.</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since its founding as Doncaster Motor Spares in 1939, Motorhog has become one of the UK's leading dismantling and salvage specialists. The company has developed and expanded considerably over the years. It now employs over 100 full-time staff and turns over several million pounds per year whilst still remaining an independent and privately owned company.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Presently our operation occupies over 50 acres spread across 10 sites. This much space is required to store the 4000+ vehicles in stock at any one time order.
